Welcome to Acro Cafe!

Quick Start:

 1) Select an area from the "Select Acro Area" dropdown (if you are a guest, choose a Guest Area)
 2) Click "Join" (from the command list above)
 3) Start acroing!

 The rules of Acrophobia are simple - each round, a random sequence of letters is presented as an acronym for players
 to create their own expansion of.

 For instance, "TIGF", while conventionally meaning "Thank God It's Friday", could also be:

    "The Internet's Getting Full"
    "This isn't Go Fish"
    "They invented Gatorate: Floridians"

    And so forth.

Quite often a round will feature a "topic" which players may try to reference in their entries.

After the composition round is over, players may then vote on which entries they like best.  The winning entry
gets a bonus (usually based on the length of the acronym) and there are also bonues for fastest entry that gains
at least one vote and for voting for the winning entry.

In most areas, the winner (or sometimes a randomly chosen player) can then choose a topic for the next round.

Once a player's score equals or exceeds the points necessary for victory (depends on the area, but typically between
20 and 30), they are declared the winner and a new game is begun.

You can chat with other players in your game by typing in the "Area Message" box in the lower left of your display.
To chat with the server as a whole, change "Area Message" to "Server Message".

Acro Cafe is very new and developing rapidly.  For updates/feedback/etc., please join our discord.
